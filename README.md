♻️ Smart Waste Classification using Arduino Uno

This project implements an IoT-based Smart Waste Classification System that automatically classifies waste into wet, dry, and metallic categories. The system is built using an Arduino Uno as the main controller, with multiple sensors and actuators to ensure efficient waste segregation and real-time monitoring.

🔧 Features

Soil Moisture Sensor – Detects wet waste

Metal Sensor – Identifies metallic waste

Ultrasonic Sensor – Detects presence/level of waste

Servo Motor – Automatically rotates bins to respective waste types

I2C LCD Display – Shows classification status

ESP8266 Integration – Sends real-time data to cloud (Blynk) for monitoring

🌐 IoT Cloud Monitoring

Data is sent to the Blynk IoT platform for remote monitoring.

Users can view waste type, bin usage, and system status from anywhere.
